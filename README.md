# Real Estate Data Analysis - Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project, Real Estate Data Analysis, was developed by Kaohsiung Dlamini as a mid-bootcamp project. The primary goal was to build a predictive model that accurately estimates house prices based on key property features. The focus was on the Washington State housing market, with data comprising 22,000 house sales from May 2014 to May 2015.

## Mission
The project serves a real estate company seeking to:
  - Estimate house values based on certain property features.
